Graphics for trouble game

The files in the root (**/**) folder are **Inkscape svgs**, they have a lot of extra stuff thrown in for editing with Inkscape.
The files in the **/svg** folder are **plain svgs** for use in the actual web client. 

When you update a graphic, open the Inkscape svg and then click "Save Copy" and save over the copy in the svg folder **as a Plain SVG**. This will make sure the client version stays up to date.
